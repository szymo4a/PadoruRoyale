PADORU!


Terms & Conditions:
- Feel free to use the model for whatever but PLEASE CREDIT ME
- Reposting is fine if you're converting the model into another format or making significant edits
- Please don't repost if you aren't making any changes

Package Includes:
- FBX model intended for VRChat, includes visemes and expressions
- 2K texture atlas
- Avatar thumbnail

Notes:
- The model doesn't have any fingers. The thumb, index and middle fingers should still automap in Unity; this is enough to allow emotes to work properly in desktop mode. I don't have VR so I don't know how well it would work with VR controls.

Tools Used:
- Blender 2.79
- Clip Studio Paint
